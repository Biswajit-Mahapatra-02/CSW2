HashSet, TreeSet classes implement the set interface.
They do not allow duplicate values.
Both are not thread safe.
They are not synchronised.

******HashSet******
Uses hashtable data structure.
Time complexity for different operations is O(1)
null values are allowed.
faster than tree set.
order of output is random.

******TreeSet******
Uses self balancing RBT
Time complexity for different operations is O(lg n)
null values are not allowed
slower than HashSet
order of output is sorted

******LinkedHashSet******
Uses hashtable with linked list
more expensive than hashset
null values are allowed
Order of output is same as insertion order


*********MAPS*********
TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap implement the set interface
They store values in key value pairs

******TreeMap******
TreeMap does not allow null keys but allows multiple null values
Time complexity is O(lg n)
Output comes in sorted order of keys.

******HashMap******
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values
Time complexity is O(1)
Output comes in random order

******LinkedHashMap******
LinkedHashMap allows one null key and multiple null values
Time complexity is O(1)
Output comes in order of insertion

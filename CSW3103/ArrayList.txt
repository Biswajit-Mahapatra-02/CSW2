ArrayList class implements list interface
ArrayList class is a representation of the dynamic array
It does not have a fixed size
Its size increases or decreases depending on whether we are adding or removing elements from it respectively
It uses array data structure internally. Hence, it allows to fetch elements through index
It allows duplicate as well as null values
It is an ordered collection. Hence, it maintains the insertion order of the elements
You cannot create an arraylist of primitive datatype
Arraylist is not synchronized
